<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
    The aim of the proposed shared tasks in FIRE 2024 is to elaborate on activities in the evaluation
    of Personalised Information Retrieval (PIR). Personalisation in Information Retrieval (IR) remains an
    important topic both in research and the development of practical applications for Information Retrieval.
    However, suitable means of evaluation of PIR remain an underexplored topic. PIR-FIRE aims to bring
    together researchers with a common interest in developing and evaluating novel methods for personalised
    operation of novel information retrieval applications.

    Personalisation and other adaptation of the search experience to the user and search context is an
    important topic in IR, studied by the research community for a long time. Personalised search aims to
    tailor the search outcome to a specific user (or group of users) based on the knowledge of their interests
    and online behaviour. Unfortunately, text collections shared by initiatives on search evaluation do not
    usually provide the information needed for evaluating personalisation, i.e., information about specific
    users and their preferences. At the same time, the field has witnessed a transformation with the recent
    availability of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite recent research that has emphasized
    the advantages and drawbacks of personalizing LLMs, the development and evaluation of LLMs
    specifically designed to generate personalized responses remains inadequately explored.
